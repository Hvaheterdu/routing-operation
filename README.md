# Router operations

This repo is my solution to the mandatory assignment in the subject IN2140 - Introduction to operating systems and data communication at the University of Oslo. This mandatory assignment was related to making router operations more effective on campus. The program has been implemented in C.

## How to run

In the Makefile, there are a variety of calls that can be made to run two example files.

First, run 

```
$ make all
```

This command will create the binary file needed to run the program.

After this, the command _run10_ and _run50_ will run based on specified files found in the _resources_ folder.

_run10_ contains a binary file with ten routers and ten edges with the respective command file.

_run50_ contains a binary file with fifty routers and one hundred and fifty edges with the respective command file.
